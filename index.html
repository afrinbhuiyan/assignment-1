                    Dr. Muhammad Yunus is a visionary Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, economist, and the founder of the
                    Grameen Bank.
                    He pioneered the concept of microcredit and microfinance, empowering millions of people, especially
                    women, to break the
                    cycle of poverty through small loans and sustainable entrepreneurship. His innovative approach has
                    transformed
                    lives worldwide and earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Dr. Yunus continues to inspire global
